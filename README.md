# SDC Training 
Joining the SDC training was my first step towards my field.This training covers no-code/ low-code full stack web application development using frappe framework.In this blog, I will be sharing my learning till now and the things I learned along with training.
During the training firstly I learnt how to create webpages using frappe framework with no knowledge of coding .

The main teaching I learnt was that we learn by doing the things.

```
“For the things we have to learn before we can do them, we learn by doing them.”
```

Then I learned markdown and learned some presentation skills which helps in building the self confidence.

Then I was able to learn about github,I was not working on github earlier but under the guidance of sir I learned about it.I learned to create new repositories. During this, I also learned how to write technical emails and how to explain the problems faced properly. 

I worked earlier on windows but in this training learned little about working on linux. Learned about how to create doctypes and how to make apps using frappe. Learned about databases and some mysql commands.Learned about python.

This was my learnings till now.
